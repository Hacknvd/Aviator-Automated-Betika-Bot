# Aviator Betting Bot

This README provides an overview of the Aviator Betting Bot. The bot automatically monitors a betting site and places bets based on the conditions specified.

# How it works

The bot starts by logging in to the betting site using the provided credentials.
After successful authentication, the bot navigates to the Aviator game page.
The bot then continuously monitors the aviator values displayed on the page.
It checks if the latest win value has changed since the last check.
If the optimal conditions are met, the bot proceeds to place a bet.
The bot keeps monitoring the win values and placing bets based on the specified conditions every 4 seconds.
Please note that the monitoring and betting process will continue indefinitely. To stop the bot, you will need to manually interrupt the script execution.

# The Aviator Bot Future
In future versions of the Aviator Betting Bot, we plan to introduce the following enhancements:

**Auto stopping of bets after a certain number of losses:** The bot will automatically stop placing bets if a predefined number of consecutive losses is reached.
Graphs to display data: Visualization of the betting data using interactive charts and graphs for better understanding of trends and patterns.
**Messaging when placing a bet:** The bot will send real-time notifications (via email, SMS, or other messaging platforms) when placing a bet, to keep the user informed.
**Improved accuracy in predictions:** Integration of machine learning algorithms and statistical models to improve the bot's decision-making process and increase the likelihood of successful bets.
**Customizable betting strategies:** Users will be able to define their own betting strategies based on specific criteria, allowing for a more personalized betting experience.
